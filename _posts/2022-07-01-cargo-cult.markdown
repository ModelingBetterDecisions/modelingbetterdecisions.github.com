The scenario where people go through the motions without knowing the purpose of them or the nuances which would impact the outcomes.  
i.e. "We do the thing because it's the thing and we've always done that thing.  It's how you Agile!"
Origin for the phrase comes from WWII when remote islands were converted into military bases.  After the war the natives created airplanes made out of bamboo to appease the gods to return the shipments of food.
