AKA: Genesis of the expertise

 We go throught a journey when learning.  
Early on, the concepts and relationships seem reasonable.  We can logically understand.  
Your understanding of a given topic is reflected in your abillity to do the thing, talk about the thing and then evenaually teach the thing so someone else can explain or do it.

The approach and words we use reflects both where we are on our jouurney and where we perceive others to be.
Attempting to teach someone is a great way to identify what you may need to learn more to be effective.
