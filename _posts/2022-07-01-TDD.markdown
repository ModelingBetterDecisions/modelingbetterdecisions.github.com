A staple of modern software development practices.  The software's design is formed when tests are first written as the purpose of the code is declared.
The test determines your context and expected result.  The test fails upon first run and shows up as the color Red in the automated test runner.  
After the code is written to implement the desired functionality, the test runner turns Green.
As the functionality has been proven, the developer can refactor the code to adhere to an improved pattern, maintaining proven functionality.
