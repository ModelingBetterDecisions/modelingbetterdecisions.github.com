Name: Dunning-Krueger Effect
Summary: 
A little bit of knowledge may be reflected with high levels of confidence amongst novices.
As more is known, confidence may drop until enough knowledge, context and experience validate's an expert's confidence.

While not to be taken as a universal law, it may be worth questioning a person’s confidence with their actual ability.  
This quick check can help us the potential for perception and reality to drift.  
Like the “The Responsibility Process”, this is applicable to ourselves as well.
