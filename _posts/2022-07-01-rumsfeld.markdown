 Matrix of Known and Unknown information.
1) Known-Knowns - The things we know we know. Things we will speak of with confidence and conviction. 
2) Known-Unknowns - That which we know we don't know.  Questions we need to find answers for.
3) Unknown-Unknowns - The things we don't know we don't know.  Often the surprise which creates misery. Requires intentional, open-ended questions to surface. Others may assume you know and you will need to be explicit to uncover invalid assumptions.
4) Unknown-knowns - Things we didn't know we know (i.e. how good of a salsa dancer we are, or we may have some info others need)

This model is useful to confirm what is known and what needs to be known.  What is fact, what is opinion?  What is assumed? How can you surface the informaiton you need?
