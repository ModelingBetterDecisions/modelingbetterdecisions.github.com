Not necessary a model, but a helpful visual reference. 
19XX's artist Rube Goldberg created unnecessarily complex processes to complete a simple task. 
Systems are often influenced by Conway's Law and Industrial-Revolution-era mindsets (Fredrick Taylor's Scientific management).
Prioritizing local-optimization can lead to many pieces which don't work well as a whole.

"Things are the way they are because they got that way" - Gerry Weinberg
This is another example of how many small decisions might be cohesive.
