Effective goals are clear goals.  
SMART is a mnemonic to make sure our goal has all the key elements for success.
Is it Specific?  Clear?  Not too generic?
Can we Measure it?
Is it Achievable, even if aspirational?
Does this deliver Results? The outcomes we desire?
Are we time-based so it doesn't just float around forever?

When Goals are being communicated, SMART includes some questions that can be asked to ensure the goals are achieved!
