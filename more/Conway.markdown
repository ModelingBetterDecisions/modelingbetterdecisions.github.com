The description of this service

Name: Conways Law
Summary: An organization's structure influences communication paths which influences an application's architecture.
If a company organizes around functional specialities, solutions will require a copious consumption of communication, collaboration, and coordination cost.

Understanding the model we exist in provides us an opportunity for a Reverse Conway manuever. This is where we work backwards with the end goal in mind. 
Instead of relying on different individuals with specialities, cross-functional/inter-disclipinary teams are leveraged.  
External expertise is utilized when needed, not as a defaultm team (i.e. DB, UI/UX, Javascript teams).  

This about this when work is easy to start, but difficult to complete due to team depencies. 
Does one unit of value need to be prioritized repeatedly for different teams?  Do teams need to decide which teams that they support will receiver faster or slower solutions?
