Name: DISC personality Model
AKA: Meyers Briggs Model
Summary: Understanding our values and how we operate is as important as recognizing the same in others. 
Often we project our own values onto others and are met with conflict.  

This is one of many personality profiles this can help highlight people’s values and motivations.  
The discussions a personality profile drives can be more valuable than the assessment itself.
